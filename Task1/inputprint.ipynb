Then if -4 <= ``exp`` < ``p``, the number is formatted with presentation type 'f' and precision ``p-1-exp``.  Otherwise, the number is formatted with presentation type 'e' and precision ``p-1``. In both cases insignificant trailing zeros are removed from the significand, and the decimal point is also removed if there are no remaining digits following it. Positive and negative infinity, positive and negative zero, and nans, are formatted as ``inf``, ``-inf``, ``0``, ``-0`` and ``nan`` (not a number) respectively, regardless of the precision.A precision of ``0`` is treated as equivalent to a precision of ``1``.
